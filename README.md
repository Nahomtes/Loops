# Practicing Loops
1. Write a program that prints the numbers 1-10.
2. Write a program that prints the numbers 1-10 backwards.
3. Write a program that prints all the odd numbers from 1-20.
4. Write a program that prints all the even numbers from 1-20.
5. Have the user input a number and print all numbers from that input value to 1.
6. Sum all values from 1-10.
7. Have the user enter a number and print the sum of all numbers from that inputted value to 1.
8. Factorial of a Number: 
   You are going to write an application to determine the factorial of a single number.
   A factorial of an integer is the product of that integer and all the integers below it. For example, the factorial of 4 is (4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24).
   The user will be required to enter an integer.
   You will then calculate the factorial of that integer and print the result to the screen.

9. Write loops to print the following: 

          i)                   ii)                  iii)
            **********            *                             *
            **********            **                          **
            **********            ***                       ***
            **********            ****                    ****
                                  *****                 *****
